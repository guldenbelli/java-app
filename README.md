# java-app

Simple, fictional Pet Grooming company application made with Java in my first year of University, to show "Add, Find, Save, Load, Print and Quit" functions.

You can also run on Terminal or Command Prompt (cmd), although you need Java JDK/SE Development Kit installed on your Mac/Windows to be able to run "PetGroomingApp.jar" with the command "java -jar PetGroomingApp.jar". 

Remember first to cd (change directory) into the folder containing this file. This way you'll be able to use my simple Java Program through the terminal/command prompt.
